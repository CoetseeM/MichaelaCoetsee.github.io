# MSc Data Science Graduate 

### Projects

- Bank Customer Chrun Prediction
This project was for my Ai and Machine learning module during my MSc in Data Science, I recieved a distinction.

In this project I applied what I learnt during the module to solve a real world problem using classical machine learning techniques. The task was to design a pipeline that conisted of preliminary analysis, selection of machine learning methods, training and test data splitting, metrics selection and evaluation. 

The goal was to help a business manager of a consumer credit card portfolio to understand why customers were closing thier accounts and to predict which customers were likely to close their account in the future.

To do this I designed a pipeline, an evaluation strategy and a set of experiments to determin the best parameters and machine learning algorithm based on the results of empirical evlautaions derived from the dataset.
