## Predictive Machine Learning Projects

- Analysis and Prediction of Bank Customer Attrition
  
_ Task Description:_ The task for this project was to design a pipeline that conisted of preliminary analysis, selection of machine learning methods, training and test data splitting, metrics selection and evaluation. 

_Goal:_ The goal was to help a business manager of a consumer credit card portfolio to understand why customers were closing thier accounts and to predict which customers were likely to close their account in the future so that the manager could impliment strategies to combat customer attrition.

_Technologies:_ Python, scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib.

_Method:_ To do this I designed a pipeline, an evaluation strategy and a set of experiments to determin the best parameters and machine learning algorithm based on the results of empirical evlautaions derived from the dataset.

_Outcome:_ This project was for my Ai and Machine learning module during my MSc in Data Science, I recieved a distinction (81%).
